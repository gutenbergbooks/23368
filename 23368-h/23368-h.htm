      THE COURTING OF LADY JANE
    </h1>
    <h2>
      By Josephine Daskam <br /> <br /> Copyright, 1903, by Charles Scribner's

    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel entered his sister's room abruptly, sat down on her bed, and
      scattered a drawerful of fluffy things laid out for packing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't seem to think about my side of the matter,&rdquo; he said gloomily.
      &ldquo;What am I to do here all alone, for Heaven's sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so like a man,&rdquo; she murmured, one arm in a trunk. &ldquo;Let me see:
      party-boots, the children's arctics, Dick's sweater&mdash;did you think I
      could live here forever, Cal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you shouldn't have come at all. Just as I get thoroughly settled
      down to flowers in the drawing-room, and rabbits in a chafing-dish, and
      people for dinner, you skip off. Why don't you bring the children here?
      What did you marry into the navy for, anyway? Nagasaki! I wouldn't live in
      a place called Nagasaki for all that money could buy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're cross,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dick placidly. &ldquo;Please get off that
      bath-wrapper. If you don't like to live alone&mdash;Six bath-towels,
      Dick's shoe-bag, my old muff (I hope and pray I'll remember that!) Helen's
      reefer&mdash;Why don't you marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry? Marry! Are you out of your mind, Dosia? I marry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonel twisted his grayish mustache into points; a look of horror
      spread over his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men have done it,&rdquo; she replied seriously, &ldquo;and lived. Look at Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at him? But how? Who ever sees him? I've ceased to believe in him,
      personally. I can't look across the Pacific. Consider my age, Dosia;
      consider my pepper-and-salt hair; consider my bronchitis; consider&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider your stupidity! As to your hair, I should hate to eat a salad
      dressed with that proportion of pepper. As to your age, remember you're
      only ten years ahead of me, and I expect to remain thirty-eight for some
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But forty-eight is centenarian to a girl of twenty-two, Dosia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonel was plaiting and un-plaiting the ball-fringe of the bed-slip;
      his eyes followed the motion of his fingers&mdash;he did not see his
      sister's triumphant smile as she dived again into the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends entirely on the girl. Take Louise Morris, for instance; she
      regards you as partly entombed, probably&rdquo;&mdash;the colonel winced
      involuntarily&mdash;&ldquo;but, on the other hand, a girl like Jane Leroy would
      have no such nonsense in her head, and she can't be much more than
      twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is twenty-two,&rdquo; cried the unsuspecting colonel eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah? I should not have said so much. Now such a girl as that, Cal,
      handsome, dignified, college-bred, is just the wife for an older man. One
      can't seem to see her marrying some young snip of her own age. She'd be
      wasted on him. I happen to know that she refused Wilbur Vail entirely on
      that ground. She admitted that he was a charming fellow, but she told her
      mother he was far too young for her. And he was twenty-eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she?&rdquo; The colonel left the fringe. &ldquo;But&mdash;but perhaps there were
      other reasons; perhaps she didn't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, probably she didn't. But still, she said he was too young. That's the
      way with these serious girls. Now I thought Dick was middle-aged when I
      married him, and he was thirty. Jane doesn't take after her mother; she
      was only nineteen when she was born&mdash;I mean, of course, when Jane was
      born. Will you hand me that crocheted shawl, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl, you're not going to try to get that into that trunk, too?
      Something will break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, my dear Clarence. Thank you. Will you send Norah up to me as
      you go down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had not occurred to the colonel that he was going down, but he decided
      that he must have been, and departed, forgetting Norah utterly before he
      had accomplished half of the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered out through the broad hall, reaching down a hat absently, and
      across the piazza. Then, half unconscious of direction, he crossed the
      neat suburban road and strolled up the gravel path of the cottage
      opposite. Mrs. Leroy was sitting in the bay-window, attaching indefinite
      yards of white lace to indefinite yards of white ruffles. Jane, in cool
      violet lawn, was reading aloud to her. Both looked up at his light knock
      at the side door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am afraid I interrupt,&rdquo; he suggested politely, as he dropped into a
      low chair with a manner that betokened the assurance of a warm welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least in the world,&rdquo; Mrs. Leroy smiled whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady is reading Pater to me for the good of my soul, and I am listening
      politely for the good of her manners,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But it is a little
      wearing for us both, for she knows I don't understand it, and I know she
      thinks me a little dishonest for pretending to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's gray eyes opened wide above her cool, creamy cheeks; the deep
      dimples that made her mother's face so girlish actually added a regularity
      and seriousness to the daughter's soft chin. Her chestnut hair was thick
      and straight, the little half-curls of the same rich tint that fell over
      her mother's forehead brushed wavelessly back on each side of a deep
      widow's peak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two older ones laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always uncompromising, Lady Jane!&rdquo; the colonel cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, colonel, when Lady begins to mark iniquities, few of us
      stand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane smiled gravely, as on two children. &ldquo;You know very well that is
      nonsense,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Hannah appeared in the door, beaming and curtsying to the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You-all ready foh yoh tea, Miss Lady?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden recollection threw Mrs. Leroy into one of her irresistible fits
      of gentle laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lady,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;do you remember that impossible creature that
      lectured me about Hannah's asking you for orders? Did I tell you about it,
      colonel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane shook her head reprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, mother dearest, you always make him out worse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse, my darling? Worse is a word that couldn't be applied to that man.
      Worse is comparative. Positive he certainly was, superlative is mild, but
      comparative&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell about it, do,&rdquo; begged the guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he came to see how Lady was growing up&mdash;he's a sort of species
      of relative&mdash;and he sat in your chair, colonel, and talked the most
      amazing Fourth Reader platitudes in a deep bass voice. And when Hannah
      asked Lady what her orders were for the grocer, he gave me a terrible look
      and rumbled out: 'I am grieved to see, Cousin Alice, that Jennie has burst
      her bounds!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounded horribly indecorous&mdash;I expected to see her in fragments
      on the floor&mdash;and I fairly gasped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gasped, mother? You laughed in his face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I, dearest? It is possible.&rdquo; Mrs. Leroy admitted. &ldquo;And when I looked
      vague he explained, 'I mean that you seem to have relinquished the reins
      very early, Cousin Alice!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Relinquished? Relinquished?' said I. 'Why, dear me, Mr. Wadham, I never
      held 'em!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He only meant, mother dear, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, my child, I know what he only meant! He explained it to me
      very fully. He meant that when a widow is left with a ten-year-old child,
      she should apply to distant cousins to manage her and her funds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgusting beast!&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed with feeling, possessing himself
      of one of Hannah's beaten biscuits, and smiling as Lady Jane's white
      fingers dropped just the right number of lumps in his tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      How charming she was, how dignified, how tender to her merry little
      mother, this grave, handsome girl! He saw her, in fancy, opposite him at
      his table, moving so stately about his big empty house, filling it with
      pretty, useless woman's things, lighting every corner with that last touch
      of grace that the most faithful housekeeper could never hope to add to his
      lonely life. For Theodosia had taught him that he was lonely. He envied
      Dick this sister of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered that marriage had never occurred to him before: simply it had
      not. Ever since that rainy day in April, twenty years ago, when they had
      buried the slender, soft-eyed little creature with his twisted silver ring
      on her cold finger, he had shut that door of life; and though it had been
      many years since the little ring had really bound him to a personality
      long faded from his mind, he had never thought to open the door&mdash;he
      had forgotten it was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a talkative man, and, like many such, he dearly loved to be
      amused and entertained by others who were in any degree attractive to him.
      The picture of these two dear women adding their wit and charm and dainty
      way of living to his days grew suddenly very vivid to him; he realized
      that it was an unconscious counting on their continued interest and
      hospitality that had made the future so comfortable for so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      With characteristic directness he began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your Ladyship allow me a half-hour of business with the
      queen-mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose easily and stepped out through the long window to the little side
      porch, then to the lawn. They watched her as she paced slowly away from
      them, a tall violet figure vivid against all the green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a dear girl, isn't she?&rdquo; said her mother softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden flood of delighted pride surged through the colonel's heart. If
      only he might keep them happy and contented and&mdash;and his! He never
      thought of them apart: no rose and bud on one stem were more essentially
      together than they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is too dear for one to be satisfied forever with even our charming
      neighborliness,&rdquo; he answered gravely. &ldquo;How long have we lived 'across the
      street from each other,' as they say here, Mrs. Leroy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not raise her eyes from her white ruffles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just a year this month,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are such good friends,&rdquo; he continued in his gentle, reserved voice,
      &ldquo;that I hesitate to break into such pleasant relations, even with the
      chance of making us all happier, perhaps. But I cannot resist the
      temptation. Could we not make one family, we three?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quick, warm color flooded her cheeks and forehead. She caught her
      breath; her startled eyes met his with a lightning-swift flash of
      something that moved him strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Colonel Driscoll?&rdquo; she asked, low and quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, could you give me your daughter&mdash;if she&mdash;at any time&mdash;could
      think it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a deep breath; the color seemed blown from her transparent skin
      like a flame from a lamp. For a moment her head seemed to droop; then she
      sat straight and moistened her lips, her eyes fixed level ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady?&rdquo; she whispered, and he was sure that she thought the word was
      spoken in her ordinary tone. &ldquo;Lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;I realize perfectly that it is a presumption in me&mdash;at
      my age&mdash;when I think of what she deserves. Oh, we won't speak of it
      again if you feel that it would be wrong!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, it is not that,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I&mdash;I have always known that
      I must lose her; but she&mdash;one is so selfish&mdash;she is all I have,
      you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would not lose her!&rdquo; he cried eagerly. &ldquo;You would only share her
      with me, dear Mrs. Leroy! Do you think&mdash;could she&mdash;it is
      possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady is an unusual girl,&rdquo; she said evenly, but with something gone out of
      her warm, gay voice. &ldquo;She has never cared for young people. I know that
      she admires you greatly. While I cannot deny that I should prefer less
      difference than lies between your ages, it would be folly in me to fail to
      recognize the desirability of the connection in every other way. Whatever
      her decision&mdash;and the matter rests entirely with her&mdash;my
      daughter and I are honored by your proposal, Colonel Driscoll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She might have been reading a carefully prepared address: her eyes never
      wavered from the wall in front&mdash;it was as if she saw her words there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then will you ask her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that you wish me to ask her to marry you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;She will feel freer in that way. You will know as
      I should not, directly, if there is any chance. I can talk about it with
      you more easily&mdash;somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders with a strange air of exhaustion; it was the
      yielding of one too tired to argue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;go now, and I will ask her. Come this evening.
      You will excuse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a vague motion. The colonel pitied her tremendously in a blind
      way. Was it all this to lose a daughter? How she loved her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps to-morrow morning,&rdquo; he suggested, but she shook her head
      vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, to-night, to-night!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Lady will know directly. Come
      tonight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out a little depressed. Already a tiny cloud hung between them.
      Suppose their pleasant waters had been troubled for worse than nothing?
      Suddenly his case appeared hopeless to him. What folly&mdash;a man of his
      years, and that fresh young creature with all her life before her! He
      wondered that he could have dreamed of it; he wished the evening over and
      the foolish mistake forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sister was full of plans and dates, and her talk covered his almost
      absolute silence. After dinner she retired again into packing, and he
      strode through the dusk to the cottage; his had not been a training that
      seeks to delay the inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women sat, as usual at this hour, on the porch. Their white gowns
      shimmered against the dark honeysuckle-vine. He halted at the steps and
      took off the old fatigue-cap he sometimes wore, standing straight and tall
      before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Leroy leaned back in her chair; the faintest possible gesture
      indicated her daughter, who had risen and stood beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Driscoll,&rdquo; she said in a low, uneven voice, &ldquo;my daughter wishes
      me to say to you that she appreciates deeply the honor you do her, and
      that if you wish it she will be your wife. She&mdash;she is sure she will
      be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonel felt his heart leap up and hit heavily against his chest. Was
      it possible? A great gratitude and pride glowed softly through him. He
      walked nearly up the steps and stood just below her, lifting her hand to
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, dear child,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;you give me too much, but you must
      not measure my thankfulness for the gift by my deserts. Whatever a man can
      do to make you and your mother happy shall be done so long as I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled gravely into his eyes and bowed her head slightly; like all her
      little motions, it had the effect of a graceful ceremony. Then, slipping
      loose her hand, she seated herself on a low stool beside her mother's
      chair, leaning against her knee. Her sweet silence charmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his accustomed seat, and they sat quietly, while the breeze puffed
      little gusts of honeysuckle across their faces. Occasional neighbors
      greeted them, strolling past; the newly watered lawns all along the street
      sent up a fresh turfy odor; now and then a bird chirped drowsily. He felt
      deliriously intimate, peacefully at home. A fine, subtle sense of <i>bien-être</i>
      penetrated his whole soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he rose to go they had hardly exchanged a dozen words. As he held,
      her hand closely, half doubting his right, she raised her face to him
      simply, and he kissed her white forehead. When he bent over her mother's
      hand it was as cold as stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the long pleasant weeks of the summer they talked and laughed and
      drove and sailed together, a happy trio. Mrs. Leroy's listless quiet of
      the first few days gave way to a brilliant, fitful gayety that enchanted
      the more silent two, and the few hours when she was not with them seemed
      incomplete. On his mentioning this to her one afternoon she shot him a
      strange glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is all wrong,&rdquo; she said abruptly. &ldquo;What will you do when I am
      gone in the winter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Gone where, when, how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear colonel,&rdquo; she said lightly, but with an obvious effort, &ldquo;do you
      imagine that I cannot leave you a honeymoon, in spite of my doting
      parenthood? I plan to spend the latter part of the winter in New York with
      friends. Perhaps by spring&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Leroy, how absurd! How cruel of you! What will Lady do? What
      shall I do? She has never been separated from you in her life. Does she
      know of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I shall tell her soon. As for what she will do&mdash;she will have
      her husband. If that is not enough for her, she should not marry the man
      who cannot&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped suddenly and controlled with great effort a rising emotion
      almost too strong for her. Again a deep, inexplicable sympathy welled up
      in him. He longed to comfort her, to give her everything she wanted. He
      blamed himself and Jane for all the trouble they were causing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon she kept in her room, and he and his fiancée drank their
      tea together alone. He was worried by the news of the morning,
      dissatisfied out of all proportion, vexed that so sensible and natural a
      proposition should leave him so uneasy and disappointed. He had meant the
      smooth, quiet life to go on without a break, and now the new relation must
      change everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at Jane, a little irritated that she should not perceive his
      mood and exorcise it. But she had not her mother's marvellous
      susceptibility. She drank her tea in serene silence. He made a few
      haphazard remarks, hoping to lose in conversation the cloud that
      threatened his evening; but she only assented tranquilly and watched the
      changing colors of the early sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you made a vow to agree with everything I say?&rdquo; he asked finally,
      half laughing, half in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; she replied placidly, &ldquo;but you surely do not want an
      argument?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he answered her, vexed at himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s novel?&rdquo; he suggested,
      as the pages, fluttering in the rising breeze, caught his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother is reading it, not I,&rdquo; she returned indifferently. &ldquo;I don't care
      very much for the new novels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily he turned as if to catch her mother's criticism of the book:
      light, perhaps, but witty, and with a little tang of harmless satire that
      always took his fancy. But she was not there. He sighed impatiently; was
      it possible he was a little bored?
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick step sounded on the gravel walk, a swish of skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Louise Morris,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I'll meet her at the gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a short conference she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you excuse me, please?&rdquo; she said, quite eagerly for her. &ldquo;Mother
      will be down soon, anyway, I am sure. Louise's brother is back; he has
      been away in the West for six years. Mother will be delighted&mdash;she
      was always so fond of Jack. Louise is making a little surprise for him. He
      must be quite grown up now. I'll go and tell mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later and she was gone. Mrs. Leroy took her place in the window,
      and imperceptibly under her gentle influence the cloud faded from his
      horizon; he forgot the doubt of an hour ago. At her suggestion he dined
      there, and found himself, as always when with his hostess, at his best. He
      felt that there was no hypocrisy in her interest in his ideas, and the
      ease with which he expressed them astonished him even while he delighted
      in it. Why could he not talk so with Jane? It occurred to him suddenly
      that it was because Jane herself talked rarely. She was, like him, a
      listener, for the most part. His mind, unusually alert and sensitive
      to-night, looked ahead to the happy winter evenings he had grown to count
      on so, and when, with an effort, he detached this third figure from the
      group to be so closely allied after Christmas-tide&mdash;the date fixed
      for the wedding&mdash;he perceived that there was a great gap in the
      picture, that the warmth and sparkle had suddenly gone. All the tenderness
      in the world could not disguise that flash of foresight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew quiet, lost in revery. She, following his mood, spoke less and
      less; and when Jane returned, late at night, escorted by a tall, bronzed
      young ranchman, she found them sitting in silence in a half-light, staring
      into the late September fire on the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the month that followed an imperceptible change crept over the three.
      The older woman was much alone&mdash;variable as an April day, now merry
      and caressing, now sombre and withdrawn. The girl clung to her mother more
      closely, sat for long minutes holding her hand, threw strange glances at
      her betrothed that would have startled him, so different were they from
      her old, steady regard, had not his now troubled sense of some impalpable
      mist that wrapped them all grown stronger every day. He avoided sitting
      alone with her, wondering sometimes at the ease with which such
      tête-à-têtes were dispensed with. Then, struck with apprehension at his
      seeming neglect, he spent his ingenuity in delicate attentions toward her,
      courtly thoughtfulness of her tastes, beautiful gifts that provoked from
      her, in turn, all the little intimacies and tender friendliness of their
      earlier intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one of these tiny crises of mutual restoration, she, sitting alone with
      him in the drawing-room, suddenly raised her eyes and looked steadily at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You care for me, then, very much?&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;You&mdash;you
      would miss&mdash;if things were different? You really count on&mdash;on&mdash;our
      marriage? Are you happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great remorse rose in him. Poor child&mdash;poor, young, unknowing
      creature, that, after all, was only twenty-two! She felt it, then, the
      strange mist that seemed to muffle his words and actions, to hold him
      back. And she had given him so much!
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hands and drew her to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, dear child,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;forgive a selfish middle-aged
      bachelor if he cannot come up to the precious ideals of the sweetest
      girlhood in the world! I am no more worthy of you, Lady dear, than I have
      ever been, but I have never felt more tender toward you, more sensible of
      all you are giving me. I cannot pretend to the wild love of the poets you
      read so much; that time, if it ever was, is past for me. I am a plain,
      unromantic person, who takes and leaves a great deal for granted&mdash;I
      thought you knew that. But you must never doubt&mdash;&rdquo; He paused a
      moment, and for the first time she interrupted him nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never will&mdash;Clarence,&rdquo; she said almost solemnly; and it struck him
      for the first time that she had never called him by his name before. He
      leaned over her, and as in one of her rare concessions she lifted her face
      up to him, he bent lower than her forehead; what compelled him to kiss her
      soft cheek rather than her lips he did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unexpected business summoned him to New York for a fortnight the next day,
      and the great city drew him irresistibly into its noisy maelstrom. The
      current of his thoughts changed absolutely. Old friends and new took up
      his leisure. His affairs, as they grew more pressing, woke in him a keen
      delight in the struggle with his opponents; as he shook hands triumphantly
      with his lawyer after a well-earned victory he felt years younger. He
      decided that he had moped too long in the country: &ldquo;We must move into town
      this season,&rdquo; he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fairly ran up the cottage steps in the gathering dusk. He longed to see
      them, full of plans for the winter. Hannah met him at the door: the ladies
      had gone to a dance at the Morrises'; there had been an invitation for
      him, so he would not intrude if he followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily changing his clothes, he walked up the street. Lights and music
      poured out of the open windows of the large house; the full moon made the
      grounds about it almost as bright as the rooms. He stepped up on the
      piazza and looked in at the swaying couples. Lady Jane, beautiful in pale
      blue mull, drifted by in her young host's arms. She was flushed with
      dancing; her hair had escaped from its usual calm. He hardly recognized
      her. As he looked out toward the old garden, he caught a glimpse of a
      flowing white gown, a lace scarf thrown over a head whose fine poise he
      could not mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young man passed him with a filmy crêpe shawl he knew well. The colonel
      stepped along with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are taking this to Mrs. Leroy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, colonel, she feels the air a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me relieve you of it,&rdquo; and he walked alone into the garden with the
      softly scented cobweb over his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing in an old neglected summer-house, her back to the door.
      As he stopped behind her and laid the soft wrap over her firm white
      shoulders, she turned her head with a startled prescience of his
      personality, and met his eyes full. He looked straight into those soft
      gray depths, and as he looked, searching for something there, he knew not
      what, troubled strangely by her nearness and the helpless surrender of her
      fastened gaze, a great light burst upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is you! it is you!&rdquo; he said hoarsely, and crushing her in his arms, he
      kissed her heavily on her yielding mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she rested against him. The music, piercingly sweet, drove
      away thought. Then she drew herself back, pushing him blindly from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;it is Lady! You are mad&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad?&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;I was never sane till now. When I think of what I
      had to offer that dear child, when I realize to what a farce of love I was
      sacrificing her&mdash;oh, Alice dearest, you are a woman; you must have
      known!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head; an unquenchable triumph smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did know!&rdquo; she cried exultantly. Suddenly her whole expression changed,
      her head sank again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lady, my child, my baby!&rdquo; she moaned, all mother now, and
      brokenhearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must never tell her, never!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;You will forget; you&mdash;I
      will go away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is you who are mad, Alice,&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;Listen to me. For all
      these weeks it has been your voice I have remembered, your face I have
      seen in imagination in my house. It is you I have missed from us three&mdash;never
      Lady. It is you I have tried to please and hoped to satisfy&mdash;not
      Lady. Ever since you told me you would not spend the winter with us I have
      been discontented. Why, Alice, I have never kissed her in my life&mdash;as
      I have kissed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She grew red to the tips of her little ears, and threw him a quick glance
      that tingled to his fingers' ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not have me&mdash;oh, my dear, it is not possible!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She burst into tears. &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;I don't know!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;It
      will break her heart! I don't understand her any more; once I could tell
      what she would think, but not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! some one is coming,&rdquo; he warned her, and taking her arm he drew her
      out through a great gap in the side of the little house, so that they
      stood hidden by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will tell him to his face what I think of him!&rdquo; said a young man's
      voice, angry, determined, but shaking with disappointment. &ldquo;To hold a girl&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not hold me&mdash;I hold myself!&rdquo; It was Lady's voice, low and
      trembling. &ldquo;It is all my fault, Jack. I bound myself before I knew what&mdash;what
      a different thing it really was. I do love him&mdash;I love him dearly,
      but not&mdash;not&mdash;No, no; I don't mean what you think&mdash;or, if I
      do, I must not. Jack, I have promised, don't you see? And when I thought
      that perhaps he didn't care so much, and asked him&mdash;oh, I told you
      how beautifully he answered me, I will never hurt him so, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is disgusting, it is horrible; he is twenty-five years older than you&mdash;he
      might be your father!&rdquo; stormed the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I never cared for young people before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Could this be Lady, this shy, faltering girl? Moved by an overmastering
      impulse, the man behind the summer-house turned his head and looked
      through the broken wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane was blushing and paling in quick succession: the waves of red
      flooded over her moved face and receded like the tide at turn. Her eyes
      were piteous; her hair fell low over her forehead; she looked incredibly
      young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the young man bitterly, &ldquo;it is a good match&mdash;a fine
      match, You will have a beautiful home and everything you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put out her hands appealingly. &ldquo;Oh, Jack, how can you hurt me so? You
      know I would live with you in a garret&mdash;on the plains&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never hurt a person so terribly to whom I have freely given my
      word,&rdquo; she said, with a touch of her old-time decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Driscoll felt his blood sweeping through his veins like wine. He
      was far too excited for finesse, too eager&mdash;and he had been so
      willing to wait, once!&mdash;for the next sweet moment when this almost
      tragedy should be resolved into its elements. He strode out into the open
      space in front of the little house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young people,&rdquo; he said, as they stared at him in absolute
      silence, &ldquo;I am, I am&mdash;&rdquo; He had intended to carry the matter off
      jocularly, but the sight of the girl's tear-stained face and the emotion
      of the minutes before had softened and awed him. His eyes seemed yet to
      hold those gray ones; he felt strangely the pressure of that soft body
      against his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;could you not believe me when I told you
      that my one wish was to make you happy as long as I lived? Happiness is
      not built on mistakes, and you must forgive us if we do not always allow
      youth to monopolize them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has always been like a dear child to me, Mr. Morris&rdquo;&mdash;he turned
      to the other man&mdash;&ldquo;and you would never wish me to change my regard
      for her, could you know it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go with him, Lady dear, and forgive me if I have ever pained you&mdash;believe
      me, I am very happy to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised her softly as she knelt before him weeping, and kissed her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is nothing to forgive,&rdquo; he assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went away hand in hand, happy, like two dazed children for whom the
      sky has suddenly but not&mdash;because they are young&mdash;too
      miraculously opened, and the shrubbery swallowed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and strode back into the shadow. Mrs. Leroy sat crouching on the
      fallen timber, her head still bent. Stooping behind her, he drew her
      toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have forgotten us by now,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;can I make you forget
      them?&rdquo;
